# Enhanced Requirements and Feature Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the enhanced requirements and architectural improvements planned for the ks-inspector project. The enhancements focus on comprehensive KSQLDB metadata collection, advanced topology visualization, and multi-source data integration.

## Project Vision Enhancement

### Current State Analysis

Based on the existing README.md, the ks-inspector tool currently provides:

- **Basic KSQL Query Analysis**: Connection to KSQL servers for query inspection
- **Simple Dependency Mapping**: Basic flow dependency graph generation
- **DOT File Export**: Graphviz-compatible output for visualization
- **Command-Line Interface**: Maven-based execution with custom profiles

### Enhanced Vision

The enhanced ks-inspector will become a comprehensive streaming topology analysis platform providing:

1. **Complete Metadata Inventory**: Full collection of KSQLDB server metadata including topics, streams, tables, and queries
2. **Advanced Topology Analysis**: Comprehensive streaming topology mapping with input/output relationships
3. **Neo4j Integration**: Professional graph database integration for advanced analysis and visualization
4. **Schema Registry Integration**: Complete schema information and evolution tracking
5. **Metrics Integration**: Confluent Cloud metrics for performance analysis
6. **Bottleneck Detection**: Automated identification of performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations

1. **Limited Scope**: Basic query dependency analysis without comprehensive metadata collection
2. **Visualization Constraints**: Simple DOT file output lacks interactive analysis capabilities
3. **Missing Context**: No schema information or performance metrics integration
4. **Operational Blindness**: Insufficient insight into streaming topology performance and bottlenecks
5. **Governance Gaps**: Limited support for compliance and data lineage requirements

### Business Impact

- **Operational Inefficiency**: Manual analysis of streaming topologies
- **Governance Challenges**: Difficulty maintaining compliance and data lineage
- **Performance Issues**: Inability to identify and resolve streaming bottlenecks
- **Architecture Debt**: Limited visibility into system design and optimization opportunities

## Solution Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The enhanced solution follows a modular monolith architecture with clear component boundaries:

```
