## Context and Problem Statement

The ks-inspector tool requires significant architectural enhancements to support comprehensive KSQLDB metadata collection, advanced topology analysis, and Neo4j integration. Several architectural decisions need to be made to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

### Key Architectural Challenges

1. **Multi-System Integration**: Need to integrate with KSQLDB, Schema Registry, Confluent Cloud, and Neo4j
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Must maintain existing functionality while adding new features
3. **Performance Requirements**: Handle large-scale deployments efficiently
4. **Data Model Complexity**: Support complex relationships between queries, topics, and schemas
5. **Extensibility**: Architecture should support future enhancements

## Decision Drivers

### Functional Drivers
- Need for comprehensive metadata collection
- Requirement for advanced graph visualization
- Integration with multiple external systems
- Support for real-time and batch processing

### Non-Functional Drivers
- Performance requirements (5-minute analysis cycles)
- Scalability to 1000+ topics and 500+ queries
- Maintainability and testability
- Security and reliability requirements

### Constraints
- Must maintain Java 8 compatibility
- Must preserve existing CLI interface
- Limited development timeline (12 weeks)
- Must work with existing deployment infrastructure

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Monolithic Enhancement
**Description**: Extend existing classes with new functionality

**Pros**:
- Minimal architectural changes
- Faster initial development
- Lower risk of breaking existing functionality

**Cons**:
- Poor separation of concerns
- Difficult to test and maintain
- Limited scalability
- Tight coupling between components

### Option 2: Microservices Architecture
**Description**: Split functionality into separate microservices

**Pros**:
- Excellent scalability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent deployment
- Technology flexibility

**Cons**:
- Increased complexity
- Network overhead
- Operational complexity
- Not suitable for current deployment model

### Option 3: Modular Monolith (CHOSEN)
**Description**: Restructure as modular monolith with clear component boundaries

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable and maintainable
- Backward compatible
- Suitable for current deployment model
- Can evolve to microservices later

**Cons**:
- More complex than monolithic approach
- Requires discipline in maintaining boundaries

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: **Modular Monolith Architecture**

### Rationale

The modular monolith approach provides the best balance of architectural benefits while maintaining compatibility with existing deployment patterns. This approach allows for:

1. **Clear Component Boundaries**: Well-defined modules with specific responsibilities
2. **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently
3. **Maintainability**: Clear interfaces and separation of concerns
4. **Evolution Path**: Can be refactored to microservices if needed
5. **Deployment Simplicity**: Maintains single JAR deployment model

## Architectural Decisions

### AD-01.1: Component Structure

**Decision**: Organize code into functional modules with clear interfaces

**Module Structure**:
```
io.confluent.cp.connector/     # Connection management
io.confluent.cp.metadata/      # Metadata collection
io.confluent.cp.schema/        # Schema registry integration
io.confluent.cp.metrics/       # Metrics collection
io.confluent.mdmodel.topology/ # Topology analysis
io.confluent.mdgraph.neo4j/    # Neo4j integration
io.confluent.mdgraph.export/   # Export capabilities
io.confluent.mdgraph.analysis/ # Analysis algorithms
```

**Rationale**: 
- Clear functional separation
- Follows existing package structure patterns
- Easy to navigate and understand
- Supports independent testing

### AD-01.2: Dependency Management

**Decision**: Use dependency injection with clear interface contracts

**Implementation**:
- Define interfaces for all major components
- Use constructor injection for dependencies
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Use factory patterns for complex object creation

**Rationale**:
- Improves testability
- Reduces coupling
- Makes dependencies explicit
- Supports mocking in tests

### AD-01.3: Data Flow Architecture

**Decision**: Implement pipeline-based data flow with immutable data structures

**Flow Pattern**:
```
Data Collection → Data Processing → Analysis → Export
```

**Key Principles**:
- Immutable data objects
- Pipeline processing pattern
- Error handling at each stage
- Incremental processing capability

**Rationale**:
- Predictable data flow
- Easier debugging and testing
- Better error handling
- Supports parallelization

### AD-01.4: Configuration Management

**Decision**: Use YAML-based configuration with environment variable support

**Configuration Approach**:
- Primary configuration in YAML files
- Environment variable overrides
- Profile-based configurations
- Runtime configuration validation

**Rationale**:
- Human-readable configuration
- Supports complex nested structures
- Environment-specific overrides
- Follows modern configuration patterns

### AD-01.5: Neo4j Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Use Neo4j Java Driver with custom graph mapping

**Integration Approach**:
- Direct Neo4j Java Driver usage
- Custom graph mapping layer
- Cypher query templates
- Batch processing for performance

**Alternative Considered**: Spring Data Neo4j
**Rejection Reason**: Too heavy for current requirements, introduces unnecessary complexity

**Rationale**:
- Direct control over Neo4j operations
- Better performance for batch operations
- Simpler debugging and troubleshooting
- Lighter weight solution

### AD-01.6: Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

**Error Handling Approach**:
- Checked exceptions for recoverable errors
- Unchecked exceptions for programming errors
- Retry mechanisms for network failures
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- Comprehensive error logging

**Rationale**:
- Robust operation in production environments
- Clear error communication to users
- Supports automated recovery
- Facilitates troubleshooting

### AD-01.7: Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layered testing approach with strong integration testing

**Testing Layers**:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Contract tests for external API interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete scenarios
- Performance tests for scalability validation

**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Early detection of integration issues
- Confidence in deployments
- Performance validation

### AD-01.8: API Evolution Strategy

**Decision**: Version APIs and maintain backward compatibility

**API Management**:
- Version all public interfaces
- Maintain backward compatibility for at least 2 versions
- Clear deprecation strategy
- Migration guides for breaking changes

**Rationale**:
- Smooth user experience during upgrades
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Clear evolution path
- Professional API management
