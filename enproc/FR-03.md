# FR-03: KSQLDB Cluster Inspection and Inventory Management

## Feature Request Overview

### Title
KSQLDB Cluster Inspection and Inventory Management with Neo4j Integration

### Status
**DRAFT** - Awaiting approval and prioritization

### Priority
**HIGH** - Core functionality enhancement

### Requested By
Project Enhancement Initiative

### Date Created
2025-09-02

---

## Problem Statement

The current ks-inspector tool lacks comprehensive KSQLDB cluster inspection capabilities that would enable users to:
1. Collect complete inventory of KSQLDB streams, tables, topics, and queries
2. Store this inventory in a structured YAML format for offline analysis
3. Export this inventory to Neo4j for advanced querying and visualization

### Current Limitations

1. **Limited KSQLDB Integration**: Existing KSQLDB functionality is basic and doesn't provide comprehensive cluster inspection
2. **No Inventory Management**: No structured approach to storing KSQLDB metadata for offline analysis
3. **Missing Neo4j Export for KSQLDB**: While Neo4j integration exists, it's not specifically tailored for KSQLDB inventory data
4. **No Standardized Data Model**: No consistent data model for representing KSQLDB entities and their relationships

### Business Impact

- **Operational Efficiency**: Difficulty in maintaining an accurate inventory of KSQLDB resources
- **Governance Challenges**: Lack of structured metadata for compliance and auditing purposes
- **Troubleshooting Complexity**: Time-consuming manual inspection of KSQLDB clusters
- **Analysis Limitations**: Inability to perform complex queries on KSQLDB metadata relationships
