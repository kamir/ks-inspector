# Capture all API Specifications

I intent to work with official APIs from CFLT cloud and with the CLI 
provided by Confluent, so that my code has less dependencies on low level 
access to any service provided by Confluent. 

Track this requirement.

Collect the OpenAPI / Swagger files for the latest Confluent Cloud services.

# Confluent Cloud APIs — OpenAPI / Swagger Overview

## Requirement
We want to **use official Confluent Cloud APIs/CLI** to minimize dependencies on low-level access.  
Where possible, we track **OpenAPI/Swagger specs** so that we can auto-generate clients or import into Postman.

---

## What to Collect (and Where)

| Area | API | Purpose | Spec availability | Docs / Source |
|------|-----|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Core Kafka (Cloud)** | **Kafka REST API v3** | Topic, consumer-group, ACL, admin via HTTPS | Documented in reference pages. OpenAPI not published as a single file. | [Kafka REST API v3 Reference](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka-rest/api.html) |
| **Cloud management** | **Confluent Cloud APIs (IAM/Org/Clusters/etc.)** | Manage orgs, environments, clusters, service accounts, RBAC, API keys | Reference docs per API. No monolithic OpenAPI. | [Confluent Cloud APIs](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html) |
| **Metrics/Monitoring** | **Confluent Cloud Metrics API v2** | Time-series metrics (Kafka, ksqlDB, Connect, etc.) | ✅ **Downloadable OpenAPI JSON** from docs. | [Metrics API docs](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/monitoring/metrics-api.html) |
| **Connect (Cloud)** | **Managed Connect REST** | Manage connectors via Cloud (UI + REST) | REST reference only. No unified OpenAPI. | Example: [GitHub Source (Cloud)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-github-source.html) |
| **Schema** | **Schema Registry (Cloud)** | Manage schemas/subjects/compatibility | REST API reference. OpenAPI not provided as single file. | [Schema Registry API](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/develop/api.html) |

---

## Commands to Fetch Specs

### 1. Metrics API — Download OpenAPI JSON
```bash
# downloads the OpenAPI JSON for the Metrics API v2
curl -L -o confluent-cloud-metrics-openapi.json \
  "$(curl -s https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/monitoring/metrics-api.html | \
     sed -n 's/.*href="$begin:math:text$https[^"]*openapi[^"]*json$end:math:text$".*/\1/p' | head -n1)"
```


Got it — I’ll track the requirement “use official Confluent Cloud APIs/CLI; minimize low-level deps” and give you a clean starter pack for pulling the latest API specs (OpenAPI/Swagger) where Confluent publishes them.

Here’s a practical plan plus the sources:

What to collect (and where)

Area	API	What it’s for	Spec availability	Docs / Source
Core Kafka (Cloud)	Kafka REST API v3	Topic/consumer-group/ACL/admin over HTTPS	Confluent documents v3 endpoints in reference pages; OpenAPI download is not exposed on docs, but endpoints are stable and versioned in the ref.	Confluent “Kafka REST API v3” reference.
Cloud management	Confluent Cloud APIs (IAM/Org/Clusters/etc.)	Org, environments, clusters, service accounts, RBAC, API keys, etc.	Documented in Confluent Cloud docs; delivered via Redoc pages. (Confluent does not publicly link a single monolithic OpenAPI bundle; you’ll use the per-API references.)	“Confluent Cloud APIs” landing & “Relevant APIs” page.
Metrics/Monitoring	Confluent Cloud Metrics API v2	Time-series metrics (Kafka, ksqlDB, Connect, etc.)	✅ Downloadable OpenAPI (JSON) directly from the docs site.	Metrics API docs with “Download the OpenAPI specification”.
Connect (Cloud)	Managed Connect REST	Manage connectors via Cloud UI/API (most control via UI + CLI). Public low-level REST for fully-managed connectors is limited; vendor details per connector.	No single OpenAPI for all managed connectors; use docs per connector and Kafka Connect REST (self-managed) when applicable.	Example: GitHub Source (Cloud) doc.
Schema	Schema Registry (Cloud)	Schemas/subjects/compatibility	Public REST is documented; OpenAPI not prominently linked as a single file.	Part of Confluent Platform/Cloud docs (ref section near Kafka REST).

TL;DR: Metrics API is the one Confluent clearly publishes as a downloadable OpenAPI file today. The Kafka REST v3 and Cloud management surfaces are fully documented but typically presented as reference docs (not a one-click swagger.json). That’s normal for Confluent Cloud.

Quick commands to fetch what’s available

1) Metrics API — download OpenAPI (JSON)

# downloads the OpenAPI JSON for the Metrics API v2
curl -L -o confluent-cloud-metrics-openapi.json \
  "$(curl -s https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/monitoring/metrics-api.html | \
     sed -n 's/.*href="\(https[^"]*openapi[^"]*json\)".*/\1/p' | head -n1)"

Source for the “Download the OpenAPI specification” link: Metrics API docs.

2) Kafka REST API v3 — pin to the official reference

While Confluent doesn’t expose a single swagger.json for v3 on the public docs, you can codegen from the reference pages (or use the Confluent-maintained client/CLI). Start from the reference and keep endpoints/versioning aligned:

3) Confluent Cloud management APIs (IAM/Orgs/etc.)

Use the Cloud “Relevant APIs” and per-API reference pages to drive your calls (and keep a small internal Postman collection in your repo). Landing page here:

How I’ll keep this current for you
	•	Single source of truth: we link only to official Confluent docs and pull the OpenAPI JSON where Confluent publishes it (Metrics).
	•	Pinned references: for Kafka REST v3 and Cloud mgmt, we pin to the reference pages and keep example collections (curl/Postman) versioned in your repo.
	•	Optional: I can set a weekly check to re-download the Metrics OpenAPI and diff it; if you want, say the word and I’ll set that reminder.

If you want, I can also seed a Postman (or Hoppscotch) workspace with:
	•	Metrics API collection (import the OpenAPI JSON directly).
	•	Kafka REST v3 collection (built from the reference endpoints).
	•	Cloud management collections (IAM, environments, clusters, service accounts).

Would you like me to draft those starter collections and a scripts/ folder with the curl smokes?
