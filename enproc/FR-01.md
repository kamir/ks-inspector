## Problem Statement

The current ks-inspector tool provides basic dependency analysis for KSQL queries and Kafka Streams applications. However, it lacks comprehensive metadata collection capabilities and advanced visualization features needed for modern streaming architecture governance and analysis.

### Current Limitations

1. **Limited Metadata Collection**: The tool currently focuses on basic query dependencies but doesn't capture comprehensive metadata about KSQLDB servers, topics, streams, and queries.

2. **Insufficient Topology Analysis**: While it creates simple dependency graphs, it doesn't provide detailed streaming topology analysis including input/output topic mapping for each query.

3. **Basic Visualization**: Current `.dot` file output is limited compared to modern graph database visualization capabilities.

4. **Missing Schema Integration**: No integration with Schema Registry to understand data structure and evolution.

5. **No Metrics Integration**: Lacks streaming metrics from Confluent Cloud for performance analysis.

6. **Limited Topic Analysis**: Insufficient analysis of topic properties, partitioning structures, and potential bottlenecks.

### Business Impact

- **Governance Challenges**: Difficulty in maintaining compliance and data lineage tracking
- **Operational Blindness**: Lack of visibility into streaming topology performance and bottlenecks
- **Architecture Debt**: Inability to identify repartitioning issues and filter bottlenecks
- **Compliance Risk**: Missing comprehensive data flow analysis for regulatory requirements
