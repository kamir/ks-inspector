## Context and Problem Statement

The ks-inspector tool requires new functionality to enable comprehensive KSQLDB cluster inspection, inventory management, and Neo4j integration. Several architectural decisions need to be made to ensure the implementation aligns with existing patterns while providing the required functionality.

### Key Architectural Challenges

1. **Integration with Existing Codebase**: Need to integrate new functionality without disrupting existing features
2. **KSQLDB Client Selection**: Choose between existing REST-based implementation or official Java API client
3. **Data Model Design**: Create appropriate data structures for KSQLDB entities and relationships
4. **Inventory Storage Format**: Select appropriate format for offline storage of inventory data
5. **Neo4j Integration Strategy**: Determine best approach for mapping KSQLDB entities to graph nodes

---

## Decision Drivers

### Functional Drivers
- Need for comprehensive KSQLDB metadata collection
- Requirement for offline inventory storage
- Integration with Neo4j for advanced analysis
- CLI interface for user interaction

### Non-Functional Drivers
- Performance requirements for large clusters
- Maintainability and testability
- Security and reliability requirements
- Backward compatibility

### Constraints
- Must maintain Java 21 compatibility
- Must preserve existing CLI interface
- Limited development timeline (4-6 weeks)
- Must work with existing deployment infrastructure

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Extend Existing REST-based Implementation
**Description**: Build upon the existing KSQLRestClient implementation

**Pros**:
- Leverages existing codebase
- Familiar implementation patterns
- No additional dependencies

**Cons**:
- Limited functionality compared to official client
- More manual work to parse responses
- Potentially less robust error handling
- May not support newer KSQLDB features

### Option 2: Use Official KSQLDB Java API Client (CHOSEN)
**Description**: Implement using the official io.confluent.ksql.api.client library

**Pros**:
- Full feature support
- Officially maintained and supported
- Better error handling and robustness
- Strongly typed API responses
- Easier to extend and maintain

**Cons**:
- Additional learning curve
- Dependency on external library
- May require updates when library changes

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
**Description**: Use official client for new features, keep REST client for legacy compatibility

**Pros**:
- Best of both worlds
- Gradual migration path
- Backward compatibility

**Cons**:
- Increased complexity
- Code duplication
- Maintenance overhead

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: **Use Official KSQLDB Java API Client**

### Rationale

The official KSQLDB Java API client provides the best foundation for building a robust and maintainable implementation. It offers:

1. **Strong Typing**: Type-safe API responses reduce errors
2. **Full Feature Support**: Access to all KSQLDB features
3. **Official Support**: Backed by Confluent with regular updates
4. **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling
5. **Future-Proof**: Easier to extend with new features

This decision aligns with the project's modernization strategy of replacing legacy implementations with official libraries.

## Architectural Decisions

### AD-03.1: Package Structure

**Decision**: Organize code into functional packages following existing patterns

**Package Structure**:
```
io.confluent.ksql.inspector/     # Main inspection functionality
io.confluent.ksql.client/        # KSQLDB client wrapper
io.confluent.ksql.inventory/     # Inventory management
io.confluent.ksql.neo4j/         # Neo4j integration
```

**Rationale**: 
- Follows existing project structure
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to navigate and understand
- Supports independent testing

### AD-03.2: Configuration Management

**Decision**: Use a combination of command-line arguments and property files

**Configuration Approach**:
- Primary configuration via CLI arguments
- Optional property file support
- Environment variable overrides
- Secure credential management

**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing CLI patterns
- Flexible configuration options
- Secure credential handling
- Follows modern configuration practices

### AD-03.3: Data Flow Architecture

**Decision**: Implement pipeline-based data flow with immutable data structures

**Flow Pattern**:
```
KSQLDB Connection → Data Collection → Inventory Creation → Storage/Export
```

**Key Principles**:
- Immutable data objects
- Pipeline processing pattern
- Error handling at each stage
- Progress feedback to user

**Rationale**:
- Predictable data flow
- Easier debugging and testing
- Better error handling
- Clear separation of concerns

### AD-03.4: Inventory Storage Format

**Decision**: Use YAML format for inventory storage

**Storage Approach**:
- Hierarchical YAML structure
- Human-readable and editable
- Support for complex nested data
- Standard library support (SnakeYAML)

**Rationale**:
- Human-readable format for manual inspection
- Good support for hierarchical data
- Widely supported and understood
- Easy to version control

### AD-03.5: Neo4j Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Use Neo4j Java Driver with custom graph mapping

**Integration Approach**:
- Direct Neo4j Java Driver usage
- Custom graph mapping layer
- Cypher query templates
- Support for incremental updates

**Rationale**:
- Direct control over graph operations
- Efficient data transfer
- Flexible mapping logic
- Support for complex queries

### AD-03.6: Error Handling and Logging

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling with structured logging

**Error Handling Approach**:
- Specific exception types for different error conditions
- Graceful degradation when partial data is available
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- User-friendly error messages

**Rationale**:
- Improved debuggability
- Better user experience
- Easier maintenance
- Robust failure recovery

### AD-03.7: Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Implement multi-level testing approach

**Testing Approach**:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Performance tests for large datasets
- Security tests for credential handling

**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Early bug detection
- Performance validation
- Security assurance

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
1. **Improved Functionality**: Comprehensive KSQLDB inspection capabilities
2. **Better Maintainability**: Use of official libraries and modern patterns
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: CLI integration with progress feedback
4. **Advanced Analysis**: Neo4j integration for complex queries

### Negative Consequences
1. **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn official KSQLDB client
2. **Dependency Management**: Additional external library dependency
3. **Migration Effort**: Potential need to migrate from existing implementations

### Risks
1. **API Changes**: KSQLDB client API changes may require updates
2. **Performance**: Large clusters may challenge performance limits
3. **Compatibility**: Integration with various KSQLDB versions

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Regular Updates**: Monitor and update dependencies regularly
2. **Performance Testing**: Test with realistic cluster sizes
3. **Version Support**: Support multiple KSQLDB versions if needed
